         <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1><br>
         <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for develops to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p><br>
         <div id="extrabody">
         <ul>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variablesmust be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<div class="bluewords">var x;</div></li><br>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<div class="bluewords">var x = 10;</div></li><br>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <div class="bluewords">true</div> or <div class="bluewords">false;</div> null - <div class="bluewords">null</div> aka nothing; Number - <div class="bluewords">42</div> or <div class="bluewords">3.14159;</div> String - <div class="bluewords">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</div> Array - <div class="bluewords"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</div> and Object - <div class="bluewords">{first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</div></li><br>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your cod eto accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <div class="bluewords">if</div> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <div class="bluewords">else if</div> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <div class="bluewords">else</div> we execute this block of code;</li><br>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to runa  mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li><br>
           <li><a href="notmuch.com">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our dunction this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we plav=ce the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more table to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.</li><br>
